# ‚ú® Personal Cloud & AI-Integrated Kubernetes Homelab

My homelab is more than just a personal Kubernetes playground‚Äîit's the keystone of my vision for decentralized, personalized technology infrastructure. This setup is my stepping stone toward reclaiming digital autonomy, enabling deep personalization, and leveraging AI integrations to enrich my daily life. It represents a philosophical stand against being locked into corporate-owned, privacy-invading ecosystems and embraces intelligent autonomy at every level.

I envision‚Äîand actively build‚Äîa computing infrastructure that serves people, not corporations. By blending Kubernetes orchestration, self-hosted applications, intelligent AI assistance, and secure decentralized data management, I'm reshaping how digital and physical life intersect, empowering myself (and ultimately, others) with sovereign ownership over data, interactions, and personal technology stacks.

# üéØ Why I'm Doing This
Learning and Exploration: Kubernetes and DevOps form the backbone of modern, scalable architectures. My homelab helps me continuously learn advanced infrastructure management while experimenting in a safe, controlled environment.

Personal Digital Sovereignty: I'm passionate about fully owning and securing my personal data. This setup is built precisely to replace reliance on third-party services with a self-managed infrastructure‚Äîgiving me direct control over privacy, security, and access.

Human-Centric AI Automation: **AI shouldn't enhance corporate profits through surveillance; it should enhance your life through intelligent personal assistance.** My goal is integrating AI deeply at a foundational level‚Äîto intelligently automate workflows, enrich personal decision-making, streamline routine tasks, and unlock insights personalized to my individual needs.
# ‚öôÔ∏è Technology & Homelab Architecture
Here's a snapshot of my current and evolving tech stack:

### Kubernetes Cluster:
#### Current setup:
Raspberry Pi 4 (Control plane)

Lenovo ThinkPad T14s node
#### Near-future (next 2-3 months):
Mac Mini (transitioning imminently)

Additional enterprise-grade mini-workstations for scalable nodes
### Storage & NAS:
Current: Synology DS923+, running 2x 8TB Seagate HDDs

Scalable: Planned expansion to 4x 8TB Seagate HDDs ($300); long-term potential of up to 4x 24TB ($2,000)

### Virtualization Server (Proxmox):
Planned: Enterprise refurb deployment, at least 32GB RAM, i7 or better processor, and 1+TB storage‚Äîflexibly ensuring powerful VM capability.
### Thin-Clients & Workstations:
MacBook Air 15" (macOS for streamlined daily productivity)

Surface Pro running Arch Linux + Hyprland (Linux productivity & lightweight tasks)
### GPU Expansion Roadmap:
Starter GPU: RTX 3060 Ti to test proof-of-concept AI workloads

Mid-term GPU strategy (3-6 months): RTX 3090 for more intensive ML/AI projects

Long-term strategy: Multi-GPU cluster (2-4x RTX 3090), possibly RTX 4090 or next-gen GPUs like RTX 5090 after validation.
# üõ†Ô∏è Core Software & DevOps Stack
Applications & systems within my Kubernetes ecosystem include but aren't limited to:

Kubernetes (via Talos Linux): Lightweight OS purpose-built for containers, Kubernetes clusters provisioned and managed cleanly and securely.

Flux & GitOps Practices: Continuous deployment & cluster state management directly from Git repositories.

Cilium CNI: eBPF-based observability, networking, and Kubernetes-aware security.

Cert-manager: Automated X.509 certificate management and renewal.

CloudNativePG: Managing resilient & scalable Postgres DB clusters within Kubernetes.

External-DNS & External Secrets: Seamlessly automated DNS interaction, and secure integration with external key vaults & secret management (e.g., Azure Key Vault integration planned).

Synology CSI Driver: Kubernetes-native Persistent Volume storage directly on NAS.

Additionally, numerous self-hosted personal applications sit atop the Kubernetes foundation: personal websites and blogs, media libraries (Plex), personal monitoring dashboards, data pipelines, bespoke IoT integrations, quantified-self metrics storage, and many more.

# üöÄ Future-Forward AI Integration
Uniquely, my homelab is architected for seamless integration of cutting-edge AI in all facets of daily life:

Deep personal context awareness, using privately-hosted datasets‚Äîpersonal contacts, health, nutrition, IoT sensor data, lifestyle preferences‚Äîcombined in a structured, well-orchestrated system readily available for querying and intelligent automation.

Powerful GPU-backed workloads for local AI processing: fine-tuning, personal model-training, data-driven recommendations, natural language interfaces, and proactive automation of routine tasks.

Secure, local-first data ownership reinforcing complete privacy, peace-of-mind, and transparent interaction between users and highly-personalized AI assistants.
# üîí The Philosophy: Decentralize & Personalize
This homelab exists at the intersection of deeply personal technology and advanced infrastructure orchestration. It serves as a demonstration of practical yet powerful digital sovereignty, proof that robust personalized computing doesn't have to come at the price of privacy, security, or autonomy.

I'm building‚Äîand openly sharing‚Äîthis personal, decentralized stack as a rallying-point for anyone looking to reclaim genuine ownership of their digital lives. It's a existential statement against corporate commodification of our lives, an empowering alternative to "having your data sold back to you," and above all, an actionable blueprint toward smarter, more autonomous, truly personalized computing.

# üí¨ Get Involved & Share Your Feedback!
